# c-finder
An easy and very simple C program to find if a certain string is in an file or not!

How to:

    If you want to compile, just:
         gcc c-finder.c -o c-finder

    To run the program:
         ./c-finder name_of_the_file

If you need any help, consult the help option: 
    - c-finder h


File-Name.txt will be the file that will contain the name of the files that matched the search word.
